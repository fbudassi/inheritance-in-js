# inheritance-in-js

The goal of this simple project is to build a simple architecture (without the help of any JS framework but with the help of a couple of simple libraries), to organize a bigger project into classes like the ones found in other languages (basically, as similar as possible to a Java program).

This project has been built with the help of the following two libs:

* https://github.com/tnhu/jsface
* https://github.com/Wolfy87/EventEmitter
