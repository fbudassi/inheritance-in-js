# inheritance-in-js-classical

This project explores the idea of Classical Inheritance in Javascript without the help of any inheritance library, just plain old JavaScript, through the usage of Constructors.

It can be considered a spin-off of https://github.com/fbudassi/inheritance-in-js-classical-lib.
